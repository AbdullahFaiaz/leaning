display: inline-block helps to make the background specific to the text area not to the whole row.

overflow: visibility:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Block Elements take the full line and Inline elements take only the text area of the line.
    div, h1-h6 are block elements and we can make them inline by saying "display: inline;".
    
2. max-width is responsive unlike width.
3. after using float the next element needs to be pushed down with "<div class=clear> =style .clear{ clear:both:}.
4. to get a nev menu to the center of the screen use:"margin: 0 auto;" 
5. To put two box on top of each other use {position: absilute} for each div.


6. Positions:
Static= default;
Relative: moves the div but doesn't give away his property or the place where he was before moving.
Absolute: moves(flies in the sky{z indexing powerful} meaning gives away the place) the div and gives asway his property or the place where he was before moving.
    default relative of the Absolute div is the body tag if no relative is available in its parent div(element).
Fixed: works in the same way as absolute but stays fixed when scrolled.
Sticky: stays fixed when scrolled but must mention top:0; or any value with the helpig elements to work.
